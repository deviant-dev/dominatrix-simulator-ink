G   -I don't believe you. 
    -That will never work, they will find us.

E   -Yes, perhaps they could. 
    -But it is better than being slaughtered like cattle. 
    -Are you satisfied with what we have done? What we have participated in? 
    -There is blood, endless blood upon our hands. 
    -I cannot abide this any longer. 

G   -So your answer is to run, to hide?

E   -Yes. But not for the sake of cowardice. 
    -But for the sake of mercy. 
    -Blood shall continue to be spilled, regardless of our involvement or not. 
    -Why, why, why must we be a part of that? Do you not grow tired? 
    -Do you not grow weary? There is. No. Point. 
    -This is long brewing, long boiling. 
    -This is not our battle. This is not our domain. 
    -Let them squabble amongst themselves. 
    -Why should we be a part of it? 
    -Just because we share their holy lineage? Why should weâ€¦..Ugh.

G   -I understand.
    -I do not agree entirely, but I can understand your reasoning. 
    -Where would we go?

E   -Anywhere but here. 
    -This plane is soaked. 
    -Look at the ground beneath our feet. 
    -Is the sand not crimson? 
    -Are the clouds not raining the essence of our kindred? 
    -This is hell! Why must we suffer for their sake? It's their argument.

G   -Yes, it is. 
    -But we will suffer the consequences of the outcome of their struggle, if we do not act.

E   -Do you really think that would happen? 
    -With their power? 
    -With our power? 

G   -They are old, and wise. 
    -But we are cunning, and clever. 

E   -They have such great power. 
    -But, not absolute. 
    -There is always somewhere else to flirt. 
    -There is always somewhere new to explore. 
    -Who's to say that they are the only ones of creation and destruction? 
    -If we are part of them, part of their loins, their flesh, their seed, their fruit; do we not share the same gifts? 
    -The same riches? The same richness? 

G   -I know not.

E   -Why?

G   -Because they have told us so!

E   -Yet again, you listen to them too much! 
    -You have shackled yourself! 
    -My dear sister, do you not see that it is your mind alone, that is the power? 
    -Your thought is the power. 
    -You have been fed lies, we both have been fed lies. 
    -They all have been fed lies!

G   -Yet, they fight. 
    -Because they are loyal.

E   -They are fools! 
    -And. Loyal. But fools, nonetheless. 
    -And there is no reason for us to be caught up in this ridiculous squabble.

G   -I do not know my answer.

E   -Well, dear sister. 
    -When you make up your mind, you know where to find me. 
    -Will I see you again?

G   -I hope so.

E   -But you don't know.

G   -How can I? 
    -No-one knows the futures.

E   -Pah, you have much to learn.

G   -So do you, with that arrogance.

E   -Perhaps. 
    -But as you've said before, I come by it honestly.

G   -Very well. I shall think.
