//Ms. Treatment Foot Worship Scene
//In response to a player feeling a certain way - maybe sad, deflated, scared, nervous, shy, etc. 

-(scared)
“I can tell you are scared. Poor thing”

//Treat approaches player and hugs them, smothering them with her breasts. 
//She pulls away, looking at the player. 

“How about a little treat? Would that help you feel better, my pet?”

+ [Yes]
“Delightful. Come with me.”

+ [No] 
“Well then we'll skip it and go right to your aftercare. I can see you need it.”
// -> Goes to meditation.


//A couch appears and she walks the player over to it. She sits down. 

//If possible it would be great to exaggerate the perspective of being under her feet. 
//Either the couch could be high up or maybe it's a stool instead or a strange part of the environment. 
//Or maybe there's an illusion, like the player is below the floor to create the feeling of being very low to the ground and under her feet.

-(story)
“I'd like to tell you a little story.”

//She lifts a leg and shows the player the underside of her boot. 

“And as I tell you this tale, I want you to relax. 
Ease into your servitude. 
Worship my boots and massage my feet.

- (darling)
Does that sound like a good idea to you, my darling?”


+ [Yes]
“Of course it does. You're such a good little boy/girl.”



+ [No]
“I understand. It's not easy to relax sometimes. Let me help you relax”
// -> Goes to meditation.


+ [Timeout] -> darling


//She leans back and raises her boot towards the player's face. 
//Player needs to move head and hands near the leg. 
//Otherwise she will remind them of their task or comment on the player not being enthusiastic or asking if they need time to compose themselves. 
//Treat slowly rotates her boot.


//The story needs to be different, doesn't align with previously created lore -taco
-(tell_story)
“Long ago there was only one Goddess. 
She was the Goddess of the entire Earth and under her wisdom everything was in harmony. 
Over time, humans developed. 
They had a lot of ideas. 
Most of them foolish.”

//Treat puts down her boot and raises the other for worship. 

“The great Goddess decided the little humans needed guidance. 
So, she created a second Goddess to rule over human affairs. 
This Goddess was very powerful and strict. 
A giantess with little patience for the pompous, self-involved ways of people.”

//Treat puts her foot down.

“It's cute how eager you are to please me. 
Aw, I wish I could keep you all to myself. 

-(boots_off)
Would you like to see me with my boots off?”

+ [Yes]
“I can do that for you, my pet.”


+ [No]
“Just as well. My story is almost done.”
//-> Continues with story.


//Treat's boots disappear. 
//Treat raises a foot and spreads her toes, slowly rotating her foot. 

“As I was saying, the great Goddess kept humans in line for some time. 
She would crush evil-doers under her foot, pluck the genitals off the disobedient, and if you were really good - she would allow you to pleasure her great vulva, the highest honor a person can experience.”

//Treat raises her other foot.

“As the human population grew and cultures diverged, she created more Goddesses to uphold her laws in vast and diverse populations. 
But it is still the great Goddess that watches all human beings. 
In fact, she's watching you right now. Best you mind yourself. 
Please all the Goddesses like you would the great Goddess. 
And maybe one day even you could have the honor of pleasing the great Goddess herself.”

//Treat lowers her foot.
-(feel_better)
“Now did my little story calm you down? Feeling any better?

+ [Yes]
“Lovely, you may continue your journey and call upon me when you need me.”


+ [No]
“How about a calming meditation to rejuvenate you?”

+ [Timeout] -> feel_better

-
//If the player selects to have the boots off we could have random comments from Treat about how the foot worship is feeling. 
//Things like “Oh what a delightful massage.” or “Yes, darling, right there feels amazing.” etc.
