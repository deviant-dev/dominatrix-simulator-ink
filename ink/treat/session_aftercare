Now, slowly let go of your focus. #309
Unclench your fists, drop your shoulders, #310
and release the tension in your muscles #311
as you feel the emotion drain from your body. #312

[Breathe In] #666

[Breathe Out] #999

/wait 5

Slowly, gently #313
bring your awareness back to the body. #314
Gently wiggle your fingers and your toes. #315
Notice how it feels to be embodied. #316

- (need) 
/music treat-aftercare-need

Ah, dear heart. #331
Of course you need a little reassurance, #332
after all of that hard work and intensity. #333

You have been working hard, haven't you. #334
Doing your best to please your Mistresses. #335

- (need_best)

You are doing your best, are you not? #336

+ [yes]
    Good {player_name}! #337
    
+ [no] 
    I know it may not feel like your best, #338
    but I need you to trust that you are enough, #339
    and let that move you, rather than shame. #340
    
+ [timeout]
    -> need_best


- I know it isn't always the easiest task, #341
and I'm proud of you for trying. #342

You're a good {player_name}. #343
I'm  proud of you for all your efforts, #344
and especially now for coming to me #345
and asking for what you need. #346

Remember that you are here to serve the Goddess Herself. #347
Every bruise, every tear, every whimper and moan #348
is worship to Her. #349

Your pleasure and your pain mingle with that of #350
every submissive in Her service #351
to form a pleasing sacrifice of passion. #352

Life and death, pleasure and pain, #353
all these things the Goddess can give and take #354
within a single breath. #355

This is your purpose, {player_name}. #356
You were made for passion, #357
and your continued existence is at Her pleasure. #358

Do you understand me? #359

I wish all my toys had your enthusiasm. #368

Do you trust me? #369

/music treat-aftercare-mind

Open your eyes. #384
Look at me, darling. #385
// need to check for not distracted -taco

Breathe. #386
Take any small movements that you need. #387

Before we conclude, #518
I'd like to spend a little time #388
reflecting on your recent experience #389
to see if you can better understand yourself #390
as well as your needs. #391

If you'd prefer, you may choose to do this part #392
on your own or with a friend. #393

- (mind_consent)

Would you like to reflect with me now? #394

+ [yes]
    Excellent. #395

    I understand, little one. #396
    -> exit
    
+ [timeout]

- (reflect) 
Take a breath with me now. #397

[Breathe In] #666

[Breathe Out] #999

Recall the scene that brought you here. #398
Remember that you are safe now. #399

Breathe with me. #400

[Breathe In] #666

[Breathe Out] #999

Whenever you feel afraid, return to the breath. #401

//stay point 
- Try not to get caught up in the memories. #402
    Just let the thoughts pass by #403
    and breathe. #404
- Stay with me. #405
- Stay with your body. #406
- Remember self-compassion. #407
- You are not alone. #408
- You will not be overcome by this. #409
- Just breathe. #410

    And let the thoughts pass by. #525




- (mind_moment)

Can you pinpoint the moment #411
where you began to notice that something was wrong? #412

+ [yes] 
    Consider how it felt in your body, #413
    what thoughts passed through your mind. #414
    
+ [no]
    Sometimes we don't get the body's message right away, #415
    until we have time to process. #416
    
+ [timeout]
    -> mind_moment

-
It is important to reflect with compassion; #417
knowing you are a complex, embodied being #418
with myriad conflicting thoughts and feelings, #419
deserving of kindness and worthy of care. #420

/wait 1 

This is not a time to be critical, #421
but rather to get curious. #422

See if you can remember what happenedâ€¦ #423

the wordsâ€¦ #424

actionsâ€¦ #425

and your head space. #426

/wait 

[Breathe In] #666

[Breathe Out] #999

Identifying a trigger, #427
whether internal or external, #428
thought, word or deed, #429
can give you a starting point to address this #430
in your own work. #431

You may have some ideas already of #432
why you were affectedâ€¦ #433

or what you might do differently in the future. #434

Perhaps that activity is unsafe for you right now, #435
or perhaps you simply need more timeâ€¦ #436
or spaceâ€¦ #437
or care. #438

Let's take a few moments to reflect. #439

/wait 30

- (mind_reflect)

Did anything come up for you, darling? #440

+ [yes]
    Very good. #441
    I want you to take that with you #442
    and use it to inform your self care #443
    and your safety plan. #444
    
+ [no]
    That's quite all right. #445
    I appreciate that you tried for me. #446
    
+ [timeout]
    -> mind_reflect 

- The most important thing is how you respond to yourself #447
in this time of vulnerability. #448

You have not failed, little one. #449
You have learned. #450
You are becoming stronger and more resilient. #451

And I am so proud of you for moving through this #452
with intentionality and care. #453

You are a very good {player_name}. #454
