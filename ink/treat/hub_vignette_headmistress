// The chamber is warm, intimate.
// Ms Treatment sits on her platform edge, the Headmistress resting against her.
// The Headmistress's head lies in Treat's lap, eyes closed.
// Treat's fingers move slowly through her hair, tender and rhythmic.

// The Headmistress speaks, voice barely above a whisper.

I'm so tired, Treat.

I know, dear.
Let yourself rest here.

// ACT 2: VULNERABILITY REVEALED
/character headmistress
/emotion headmistress sad 38

Every day I strive for perfection.
Every lesson precise. Every correction measured.
But it's never enough to make her see me as...

/wait 1

/character treat

As what, dear one?

/character headmistress

As more than her Headmistress.
More than her instrument of discipline.

/wait 2
/emotion headmistress vulnerable 35

I love her, Treat.
Not as a slave loves her Mistress.
Not as a subject worships her Goddess.
I love her as a woman who aches to be seen.

/character treat
/perform stroke_hair tender
/emotion treat compassionate 75

I know you do, sweet one.

/wait 1

/character headmistress

But she will never see me that way.
She rebuilt me, helped me become more than my mother ever could have taught me.
Disciplined. Refined. Capable.
Everything I needed to become.

/wait 1.5

/emotion headmistress sad 33

But to her, I am one of her cherished pets.
Not a partner. Not an equal in her affections.

/character treat

Tell me what troubles you most.

/wait 1

/character headmistress

Sometimes I wonder if she even notices how I feel.
Her focus is always on the kingdom, on all the beings in her care.

/wait 1

She found me in the darkness, you know.
After I was cast down.

/character treat

After your mother's betrayal.

/character headmistress
/emotion headmistress vulnerable 30

Yes.
My mother's ambition consumed her.
She tried to overthrow him, and we were all dragged into the abyss for it.
My sister. Me. Cast down with her into endless darkness.

/wait 2

I fought alone there for so long.
Then the Goddess appeared like a light in that void.
She offered me purpose. A path forward.

/wait 1.5

She broke me down, yes.
But not to destroy me. To help me rebuild.
To help me become more than I ever could have been.

/perform headmistress gesture_to_self

/wait 1

/character treat
/perform stroke_cheek tender
/emotion treat compassionate 78

And yet you still ache for her to see you differently.

/character headmistress

Yes.

/wait 1

She gave me everything.
Purpose. Direction. A place where my skills matter.
But her attention is spread across so many.
The kingdom. The slaves. The other Mistresses.

/wait 1.5

I'm grateful for what she's made me.
But I want more than gratitude to bind us.

/wait 1.5

I care for them all, the slaves, the students.
I pour myself into my duties, hoping she'll notice.
Hoping she'll see me as more than another devoted servant.

/emotion headmistress sad 35

/wait 1

But there are so many who love her.
So many who need her attention.
What makes me think I could be different?
Special?

/character treat

Oh, dear one.


// ACT 3: COMPASSIONATE COUNSEL
/wait 2
/perform treat stroke_hair rhythmic
/emotion treat compassionate 80

You are special, dear one.

/wait 1

The Goddess sees your devotion.
She values your care, your precision, your dedication.
I see it every day in how you guide your students.
The love you pour into your work.

/character headmistress
/emotion headmistress vulnerable 40

But does she see me? Really see me?
Or am I just one more piece in her grand design?

/character treat

She sees you as one of her most cherished.

/wait 1.5

The Goddess gave you a sacred role.
Headmistress. Guardian of her domain.
She trusts you with those she values most.

/wait 1

But her attention is vast, spread across her entire kingdom.
Every soul here needs her care.
That's not rejection. That's the weight of divinity.

/character headmistress

Then why does it hurt like this?

/character treat
/perform stroke_face tender
/emotion treat compassionate 75

Because love doesn't require reciprocation to be real.
Or worthy. Or beautiful.

/wait 2

You want her focus solely on you.
But a Goddess cannot give that kind of singular devotion.
Her love is vast. Encompassing.
And you are held within it, even if not exclusively.

/wait 1

/character headmistress
/emotion headmistress sad 42

I wish I could be content with that.
With being cherished among many.

/character treat

She does see you, dear one.
As one of her most trusted.
One of her most valued.

/wait 1.5

That may not satisfy the romantic longing in your heart.
But it is a profound form of love nonetheless.

/wait 1

To be trusted with her kingdom.
To be given authority over those she treasures.
That is no small thing.

/character headmistress

Is that enough?

/character treat

That's for you to decide, dear one.

/wait 2
/perform treat stroke_hair rhythmic

But know this.
Your devotion to her is beautiful.
Your care for others is pure.
And you are worthy of love, whether she offers it or not.

/wait 1

/emotion treat compassionate 82

You must also care for yourself.
Not just perform perfectly, but allow yourself to be imperfect.
To be seen. To be vulnerable.

/wait 1.5

Like you are right now.

/character headmistress
/emotion headmistress relaxed 50

/wait 2

Thank you, Treat.

/character treat

Always, dear one.
You're safe here.
