/perform idle_cocks_head_to_left amused 60
Subject is selected to undergo
endurance training and enhancement protocol No.17:
Dancing Doll. 

/perform idle_skeptical skeptical 55
To complete this protocol,
Specimen 33 must demonstrate coordinated levels of 
intuition and calculation
that will trigger climax in Specimen 7.

/perform react_thankful 
We seek ultimate perfection in our specimens.

/perform do_arm_raise 
Refinement of the form and movement is necessary
to achieve this result.

/perform talk_one_hand
Human passion is unruly. 
We see, however, that it has potential
to express Divine Beauty. 

/perform talk_thoughtful
We believe the human action of Dance 
can display Divine Beauty.

Organic subjects are uniquely, 
though imperfectly, formed for 
the intuition and calculation
required to complete dance movements. 

/perform talk_gesture 
Attend. 

/perform talk_behold
This slave is in thrall to the Divine Engine. 
It cannot escape and will experience 
every sensation the machine can offer.

/perform idle_cocks_head_to_left
The doll's purpose is to work the machine
— and to create beauty — 
by dancing.

/perform react_scoffs
Physical endurance is key to this task. 

/perform talk_lean_forward
The only technical requirement of the dance 

/perform talk_emphatic_one_hand
is perpetual motion of the hands and head.
Subject must display both endurance
and aesthetic sensibility.

/perform idle_skeptical
A successful effort will result in climax 
for the specimen on the machine.

However.
If the subject does not perform adequately,
the subject will restart the dance sequence.
