//pragma loves beautiful things - her gallery is filled with her creations of perfection
//pragma seeks to perfect you and add you to her collection

//Player enters scene in one of the statue cubbies around the outer edge of the room
//Pragma has a slave on a table on the main platform and circles around them, leaning forward to inspect various parts of the body

This subject is almost ready.

Achieving perfection is a process that must not be rushed.
Just a few more modifications... yes.
The legs... still too short.
Hrm... yes... the breasts must be firmer.
A few more sessions and we will soon be able to add it to our collection.

//pragma stops and looks up and away

We must reflect further.
Time for our next restoration project.

//scene reloads with the slave gone and the player standing before pragma
//after preview of Pragma with slave, scene reloads with player in the center of the platform - they are now a posable doll

What an interesting new specimen.

So many imperfections.
Yet perhaps this one might out perform the others.

You. There.
Turn around slowly so that we may inspect your chassis.
What type of configuration is this?

//player has to rotate 360 degrees
//continutious action or quarter turn poses?
//comments while Turning

We are intrigued.
We haven't been able to go as far as we would like.
But perhaps this specimen is worthy to endure full stress testing.

We will start with a basic examination.

Hold out your arms to your sides.

//player pose - T-pose

Adequate structure.
This is good.

Arms above your head.
Stretch fully.

//player pose - arms reaching toward sky

Tolerable mass.

Curl yourself into a ball.

//player pose - drop down to wrap arms around legs like a ball

Ugh. That is not at all spherical, 
but we detect passable flexibility.
This specimen will suffice.

Stand.

You are designated specimen 33.
An imperfect machine that must be transformed
into the perfect passion generator.


//malfunctioning machine

We should begin immediately.
The best results come from willing participants.

Specimen 33, 
do you consent to begin the experiment immediately?

//Pragma makes the player hold various positions for long durations while she inspects them
//if the player moves out of position, she throws them out and comments on them as an inferior specimen
//during posing, she refers to the player as 'it', as if recording a clinical experiment, commenting on their numerous deficiencies and flaws, talking about them as if they are not conscious or aware
//Dialogue would be her talking to herself, formulating a repair plan or disassembly procedure to break them down into individual components and rebuild them into a 'drone of perfection'
//speaking manner influenced by 7 or 9 or Borg

//test subject, trying to find limits of this "thing", stress tests, it's no more important than a sample
//extreme objectification
//dressed up, decorated
//gameplay - hold arms out to sides, slapped repeatedly, holding positions, undergoing repetitive activity, keeping going until have to stop (pragma is impressed or disappointed with specimen)


//doesn't understand passion so she's researching it (fucking machines)
//for some reason you creatures require orgasms, which I don't really understand, so let's test how many you can endure (reward)

//punishments - not worth much more than furtniture, so you should hold positions as furniture

//task - you need to be more like the ideal sexual creature, which is obviously the ultimate female, you need to be a passion generator, you need to be aesthetically hyper sexualized to trigger this state in other souls - according to my experiments, the female form is the ideal sexual object so I will turn you into this, just as the Mistresses are - put them in a costume and then perform a moving task (ie dancing)

//many of my experiments have failed, as you can see - gestures around; i need to have more passion in my projects, I'm working on finding ways to perfect this mess,

//hint at 4th wall - imagine yourself

//task - headset, hands have to all be moving for set amount of time - player is dancing to make other NPCs hooked up to fucking machines orgasm (they are in the pragma 'perfoect form' shape)

//pragma is already the perfect form - player is given her form to wear when performing task, they get to modify her body (blend shapes for breasts, butt, hair, height, etc)

//pragma's experiments are to extract as much essence as possible, which can come from pleasure, pain, discomfort, embarassment, etc

-> exit
