/perform do_walk_turn_in_place_repeated happy 50
This subject is almost ready. #01


/wait 1
Achieving perfection is a process that must not be rushed. #02


/wait 1
/perform idle_hand_on_hip
Just a few more modifications... yes. #03


/wait 1
/perform talk_lean_forward
The legs... still too short. #04


/wait 1

Yes... the breasts must be firmer. #05

/wait 1
/perform talk_thoughtful skeptical 50
A few more sessions and we will soon be able to add it to our collection. #06

//No other performances until she stops to notice the player
//This is to stop the walking animation from breaking


/perform idle_unhappy_arms_crossed skeptical 50
We must reflect further. #07

//pragma stops and looks up and away
/lookat player

/perform do_snap_fingers happy 50
Time for our next restoration project. #08

//scene reloads with the slave gone and the player standing before pragma
//after preview of Pragma with slave, scene reloads with player in the center of the platform - they are now a posable doll

/lookat player
/character pragma talk_consider happy 50
What an interesting new specimen. #09

/perform react_shake_head_disbelief
So many imperfections and possibilities. #10

/perform talk_thoughtful
We wonder if this one could endure complete testing? #11

/lookat player
/perform idle_hand_on_hip neutral
Specimen. #12


- (turn_once)


/perform do_snap_fingers happy 50
Turn to the right, so we may inspect its chassis. #13

+[pose: present_stand_right]
    -> Pragma_GoodJob ->
    /emotion happy 50
    The lines and angles appear adequate. #14
    /emotion neutral
    Solid enough to begin with. #15

- (configuration)
/perform talk_one_hand
We wonder... #16
/perform talk_question skeptical 50
What type of configuration is this? #17

Let us see it from the back. #18

+[pose: present_stand_reverse]
    -> Pragma_GoodJob ->
    /perform do_shake_finger
    This is a model we have seen before, #19
    /emotion neutral
    but a newer version. #20
    
    Many specifications we can modify. #21
    
    /emotion happy 50
    This bodes well. #22
    /emotion neutral

Turn again. #23

/perform talk_consider
This chassis intrigues me. #27
we see potential in this one. #28
Until now, #29
we haven't been able to go far #30
with the others. #31
/emotion skeptical 50
Perhaps this specimen could endure initial stress testing. #32

/wait 1

Subject. #33
Have you endured stress testing before? #34

A deeper examination must be performed. #36


/perform idle_unhappy happy 50
Hold your arms out to the side. #37

//player pose - T-pose

/wait 1
/perform react_nod_little skeptical 50
We agree. #38
The structure is adequate enough. #39
It needs tightening, though. #40

/wait 1

/perform talk_thoughtful
We are not disappointed, so far. #41


Now. #42

/wait 1
/perform talk_one_hand happy 50
Arms straight up to the sky. #43

/perform idle_clasp_hands
/wait 1 
Stretch fully. #44

-(head_pose)

Hold still. #45

/wait 1
/emotion skeptical 50
Tolerable mass. #46
There is sufficient flesh to adjust. #47

/perform do_point_down happy 50
Curl into a ball. #48

-(ball_pose)

//Grovel is a good pose, as the player is clearly in need of testing and modification
+[pose: grovel]

/perform talk_annoyed disgusted 50
This creature is clearly not perfect. #49
That is not at all spherical, #50
/emotion happy 50
but we detect enough flexibility #51
to complete all tests. #52

/perform react_dismissive
This specimen will suffice. #53

Stand. #54

-(designation)

It should be assigned a designation, #55

Does it agree to be a specimen? #57

    You should be studied. #58

You are designated Specimen 33. #62

/perform talk_behold
An imperfect machine that must be transformed #63
into the perfectly formed passion generator. #64


//malfunctioning machine
/perform talk_one_hand skeptical 50
Stress and endurance testing must occur first. #65

Followed by physical modifications and improvements. #66

/perform idle_clasp_hands happy 50

A willing participant is one who is ready to begin with no delay. #67

/emotion skeptical 50
We wonder if this one is eager to improve? #68

Does Specimen 33 consent to begin immediately? #69

-> pragma_task_posing_doll

//Pragma makes the player hold various positions for long durations while she inspects them
//if the player moves out of position, she throws them out and comments on them as an inferior specimen
//during posing, she refers to the player as 'it', as if recording a clinical experiment, commenting on their numerous deficiencies and flaws, talking about them as if they are not conscious or aware
//Dialogue would be her talking to herself, formulating a repair plan or disassembly procedure to break them down into individual components and rebuild them into a 'drone of perfection'
//speaking manner influenced by 7 or 9 or Borg
//test subject, trying to find limits of this "thing", stress tests, it's no more important than a sample
//extreme objectification
//dressed up, decorated
//game play - hold arms out to sides, slapped repeatedly, holding positions, undergoing repetitive activity, keeping going until have to stop (pragma is impressed or disappointed with specimen)
//doesn't understand passion so she's researching it (fucking machines)
//for some reason you creatures require orgasms, which I don't really understand, so let's test how many you can endure (reward)
//punishments - not worth much more than furniture, so you should hold positions as furniture
//task - you need to be more like the ideal sexual creature, which is obviously the ultimate female, you need to be a passion generator, you need to be aesthetically hyper sexualized to trigger this state in other souls - according to my experiments, the female form is the ideal sexual object so I will turn you into this, just as the Mistresses are - put them in a costume and then perform a moving task (ie dancing)
//many of my experiments have failed, as you can see - gestures around; i need to have more passion in my projects, I'm working on finding ways to perfect this mess,
//hint at 4th wall - imagine yourself
//task - headset, hands have to all be moving for set amount of time - player is dancing to make other NPCs hooked up to fucking machines orgasm (they are in the pragma 'perfect form' shape)
//pragma is already the perfect form - player is given her form to wear when performing task, they get to modify her body (blend shapes for breasts, butt, hair, height, etc)
//pragma's experiments are to extract as much essence as possible, which can come from pleasure, pain, discomfort, embarrassment, etc
//Questions:
//How do you know that all your memories are true?
//If we keep replacing old parts of you with new parts, does it make you new or old?
//When you were born, were you living or dying?
//What is the opposite of the word, ‘opposite’?
//“The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled.“
