/perform do_walk_turn_in_place_repeated
This subject is almost ready. #01

/perform talk_thoughtful
/wait 1
Achieving perfection is a process that must not be rushed. #02

/perform do_walk_turn_in_place_repeated
/wait 1
Just a few more modifications... yes. #03

/perform talk_lean_forward
/wait 1
The legs... still too short. #04

/perform do_walk_turn_in_place_repeated
/wait 1
Hrm... yes... the breasts must be firmer. #05

/talk_consider
/wait 1
A few more sessions and we will soon be able to add it to our collection. #06




/perform idle_unhappy_arms_crossed angry 25
We must reflect further. #07

//pragma stops and looks up and away
/lookat player

/perform do_snap_fingers happy 50
Time for our next restoration project. #08

//scene reloads with the slave gone and the player standing before pragma
//after preview of Pragma with slave, scene reloads with player in the center of the platform - they are now a posable doll

What an interesting new specimen. #09

/wait 1

/perform react_shake_head_disbelief
So many imperfections. #10

/wait 1
/perform talk_thoughtful
Yet perhaps this one might out perform the others. #11

/wait 1
/perform idle_hand_on_hip
Specimen. #12

/wait 1
/perform talk_one_finger
Turn around slowly, so we may inspect its chassis. #13

/wait 1
/perform talk_one_hand
What type of configuration is this? #14

-(configuration)

//player has to rotate 360 degrees
//continutious action or quarter turn poses?
//Quarter turns for now -Taco
//comments while Turning

We are intrigued.

- /perform talk_lean_forward
Keep going.

+[pose: turn_right_180]
-> Pragma_GoodJob ->

/perform idle_cocks_head_to_left
I see potential in this one.

/wait 1
Until now, 
we haven't been able to go far
with the others.

- /perform talk_consider

Turn again.

+[pose: turn_right_270]

- Perhaps this specimen could endure full stress testing.

/wait 1
Have you endured stress testing before?

We will start with a basic examination.

/perform idle_unhappy
Hold your arms out to the side.

-(t_pose)

+[pose: pose]
//player pose - T-pose

/wait 1
/perform react_nod_little
Adequate structure.

It's so important to have a solid frame to work with.
/wait 1

/perform talk_thoughtful
This is good.


Now. 

/wait 1
/perform talk_one_hand
Arms straight up to the sky.

/perform idle_unhappy
/wait 1
Stretch fully. #20

-(head_pose)

+[pose: tall_pose]
TODO: create new tall_pose

Hold still.

/wait 1
Tolerable mass. #21

//add comments about what can be done with that mass
/wait 1S
Curl into a ball.

-(ball_pose)

//player pose - drop down to wrap arms around legs like a ball
+[pose: ball_pose]
TODO: create ball_pose
/perform talk_annoyed
Ugh. That is not at all spherical, #23
but we detect passable flexibility. #24

/perform react_dismissive
This specimen will suffice. #25

//make comment about what flexiblity will do
-(suffice)

It should be asssigned a designation, 
but first it must agree to be studied.

Does it agree to be my specimen?

+[yes]
    -> Pragma_AcknowledgeYes ->

+[no]
    -> Pragma_AcknowledgeNo ->
    Poor response.
    
    You should be studied.
    
    Do you agree?
    
    ++[yes]
    Appropriate response.
    
    ++[no]
    This subject must now leave.

Stand. #26

/perform react_point_at_player_angry
You are designated specimen 33. #27

/perform talk_behold
An imperfect machine that must be transformed #28
into the perfect passion generator. #29


//malfunctioning machine
/perform do_smooth_skirt
We should begin immediately. #30

/perform idle_clasp_hands
The best results come from willing participants. #31

-(experiment)

Specimen 33, #32
does it consent to begin the experiment immediately? #33

    /perform idle_clasp_hands amused 50
    A satisfactory answer. #34

+ [no]
    ~ addDisobey()
    /perform talk_lean_forward angry 55
    Curious. #35

    /perform talk_one_finger angry 70
    An illogical answer. #36

    /perform talk_consider amused 40
    A first flaw. #37
    
    Return another time to be properly studied.

-> pragma_task_posing_doll

//Pragma makes the player hold various positions for long durations while she inspects them
//if the player moves out of position, she throws them out and comments on them as an inferior specimen
//during posing, she refers to the player as 'it', as if recording a clinical experiment, commenting on their numerous deficiencies and flaws, talking about them as if they are not conscious or aware
//Dialogue would be her talking to herself, formulating a repair plan or disassembly procedure to break them down into individual components and rebuild them into a 'drone of perfection'
//speaking manner influenced by 7 or 9 or Borg

//test subject, trying to find limits of this "thing", stress tests, it's no more important than a sample
//extreme objectification
//dressed up, decorated
//gameplay - hold arms out to sides, slapped repeatedly, holding positions, undergoing repetitive activity, keeping going until have to stop (pragma is impressed or disappointed with specimen)


//doesn't understand passion so she's researching it (fucking machines)
//for some reason you creatures require orgasms, which I don't really understand, so let's test how many you can endure (reward)

//punishments - not worth much more than furniture, so you should hold positions as furniture

//task - you need to be more like the ideal sexual creature, which is obviously the ultimate female, you need to be a passion generator, you need to be aesthetically hyper sexualized to trigger this state in other souls - according to my experiments, the female form is the ideal sexual object so I will turn you into this, just as the Mistresses are - put them in a costume and then perform a moving task (ie dancing)

//many of my experiments have failed, as you can see - gestures around; i need to have more passion in my projects, I'm working on finding ways to perfect this mess,

//hint at 4th wall - imagine yourself

//task - headset, hands have to all be moving for set amount of time - player is dancing to make other NPCs hooked up to fucking machines orgasm (they are in the pragma 'perfoect form' shape)

//pragma is already the perfect form - player is given her form to wear when performing task, they get to modify her body (blend shapes for breasts, butt, hair, height, etc)

//pragma's experiments are to extract as much essence as possible, which can come from pleasure, pain, discomfort, embarassment, etc
