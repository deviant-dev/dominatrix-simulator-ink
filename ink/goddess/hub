//first visit, player encounters Goddess and gets hint about needing more rewards first
//future visits, the door can be locked if they don't have 10 bloodstones, but they need to know why they can't enter - could be acheived with in game notification or whisper 

//future idea - Yuki could tell you that you can't enter and why, which would require scene reloading and returning player to entry hub
