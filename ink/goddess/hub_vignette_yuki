=== goddess_vignette_yuki ===
// Vignette: Player unintentionally spies on Goddess advising Yuki-Onna.
// Emphasizes Yuki's split from Nega-Yuki; softer, elusive hints to Goddess's ancient past (veiled descent, shedding layers, reclaiming power).
// Yuki: Exuberant yet nervous, eager to please, gentle. Snow spirit referenced subtly once.
// No shuffles/variations. Player ignored until end → punishment.

Come here, Yuki-Onna. #01

Yes, Goddess!

Have I done well? 
I've been working so hard with my puppies.

/character goddess

Shh. Let me look at you.

/perform goddess circle_player slow // or equivalent circling perform if available

Sweet little, snow spirit. #44
So eager to please. #04
But your puppies always leave wanting more.
Don't they? #05

- /character yuki
/perform react_confused sad 45

I... I don't understand, Goddess. #06

/character goddess
/perform talk_thoughtful aroused 65

You give them comfort when they crave intensity. #07
Gentle touches when they hunger for your control. #08
They need to feel you, Yuki. #45
Truly feel you. #09

- /character yuki
/perform idle_clasp_hands nervous 60

But I do make them obey! #46
They're good puppies for me! #10

/character goddess
/perform idle_fake_annoyed sad 60


Obedience without desire is just... 
compliance. #11

/wait 1
/perform goddess stroke_cheek tender // or similar gentle touch

Do you know why you were split? #12
Why Nega-Yuki exists apart from you? #13

- /character yuki
/perform idle_confused skeptical 75

Ummm...
To help me become a better Mistress? #14

/character goddess
/perform talk_lean_forward amused 60

To show you what you're capable of becoming. #15
She embodies the intensity you keep locked away. #16
The raw power you're afraid to touch. #17
She is your darkness brought to light.

- /character yuki
/perform react_shake_head scared 60

But Goddess, I'm not like Nega. #47
I don't want to be scary or mean. #18

/perform talk_excited excited 60
I love my puppies.
I want them to know how special they are to me.

/perform react_scoffs disgusted 60
She's always so demanding and rude.

/character goddess
/perform talk_lean_forward aroused 70

I'm not asking you to be cruel, little one. #19
I'm asking you to let them drown in you. #20

/perform idle aroused 60
Your gentleness can be overwhelming. #48
Intoxicating. #21

/perform idle_skeptical skeptical 60
But only if you stop holding back. #22

/wait 1.5

Once, long ago, power demanded shedding layers. #49

/perform talk_behold aroused 60
Veils of the old self cast aside at ancient gates. #23
Emerging not diminished, but whole. #50

/perform react_scoffs happy 60
Shedding layers is a gift.
Allowing us to reclaim our true selves. #24
Raising us up to embody our full light.

- /character yuki
/perform react_thoughtful skeptical 55

What if I go too far? #25

/character goddess
/perform idle_tease amused 60

That's why both halves exist, sweet thing. #26

/perform talk_gesture amused 90
Nega shows you the edge. #51

/perform talk_question skeptical 60
You choose how close to walk to it. #27
But you must walk toward it. 
Not away. #28

Your gentle nature is a gift. #52
But unleashed? #53

/perform do_raise_hand excited 60
It becomes rapture. #29

/perform react_scoffs happy 60
Stop tempering yourself. #54

/perform talk_behold aroused 80
Let them feel the full weight of your affection. #30
Make them beg for your softness the way they'd beg for air. #31

/perform idle_foot scared 60

How do I do that, Goddess? #32

/character goddess
/perform talk_lean_forward amused 60

Next time they whimper? #55
Don't rush to soothe them. #56

/perform react_scoffs amused 75
Let them ache for it. #33

/perform talk_thoughtful skeptical 60
Next time they please you? #57

/perform idle_tease aroused 90
Make them understand what a privilege that is. #34

/perform talk_gesture amused 90
Watch what Nega does. #58
Then find your own way. #35

/wait 2
/perform goddess idle happy 60

You have so much potential, Yuki-Onna. #59
I want to see you bloom. #36

/perform talk_question amused 80
Show me what happens when innocence stops apologizing for its power. #37

And you, naughty {player_name}... #60

/perform idle_skeptical angry 75
Lurking uninvited in my shadows? #38
How bold to eavesdrop on private counsel. #39
Boldness without permission earns its price. #40
