//These are brief moments of watching Mistresses do other things before they acknowledge your presence, similar to the lightning flashes the first time you meet the Goddess.
//They can include sexual interactions, conversations, Mistresses doing something solitary, or convey bits of unsatisfactory

//Ideas:

TODO: Fairly easy - easy to put slave on wheel, wheel already turns, small amount of dialogue
//Goddess stands before the slave on the wheel, cooing and soothing them, praising them for pleasing her with their obedience

TODO: Medium difficulty - no sucking animation built already, no dialogue
//A slave is on the floor before the Goddess worshipping her 'dildo cock' (non-game lewd)


TODO: Medium difficulty - new animation for reading while sitting, small amount of dialogue
//The Goddess reads a letter at her desk, maybe muttering softly about her most obedient possession (referring to the Headmistress)

TODO: Hard difficulty - two characters, new interactive animations as they respond to each other, small amount of dialogue
//The Goddess talks softly with the Headmistress and caresses her cheek

TODO: Hard difficulty - new masturbating animation in new position, small dialogue
//Nega lays on her bed, masturbating and laughing about the Goddess not seeing everything

TODO: Medium difficulty - new lighting animation, small amount of dialogue
//One of the statues on the Goddesses bed glows softly and whispers to the player (the soul of a slave that is turning inanimate)


// Goddess arguing with her sister, Ereshkigal (the House), who embodies in one of the statues at the foot of the Goddess’s bed. They are arguing about the House controlling the kingdom and the Goddess gets to run it because Ereshkigal allows her too. 
// The House has turned many humans into furniture and speaks to the Goddess through one of them
// The House is Ereshkigal’s underworld where kinky humans suffer judgment in their afterlife
// Ereshkigal is mesopotamian and the goddess of the underworld
// The Goddess is her sister Innana who humans continued to worship even after they stopped worshiping Ereshkigal
// After Ereshkigal is no longer worshiped by humans, the lord of the underworld became a male figure in human lore / religion
// The Goddess was the figure of fertility and passion, so she was carried on into additional human religions
// In the mesopotamian lore, Ereshkigal tricked her sister into coming to the underworld and made her strip 7 layers of clothing off as she passed through 7 gates until she arrived in from of Ereshkigal naked
