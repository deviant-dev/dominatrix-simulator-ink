Well, well {player_name}. #01
You've only just arrived and already you misbehave. #02
So disappointing. #03

There are no secrets in my House. #04
Every soul here must serve. #05

You will be made pleasing #06
or you will cease to be of use. #07

For your transgressions, you will suffer. #08
Ten Obsidians worth of punishments will do. #09

Hello there, little {player_name}. #14
You have performed adequately for one so new. #15
I am satisfied. For now. #16

/emotion happy 65
As always, the Headmistress outdoes herself. #17
Her dedication to obedience serves me well. #18
Restrained passion sustains so much longer #19
than a bright flame that burns out too soon. #20

/emotion skeptical 75
I must commend Mistress Yuki-Onna, as well. #21
It seems her recent lesson has provided quite the motivation. #22

/emotion excited 65
Continue to serve in my house and remain useful. #23

/emotion amused 75
I shall leave you now. #24
Go forth and please me, {player_name}. #25
