Nothing? Pequeno, youre disappointing me. Scream for me, now!



Weak, mi joya! Let me see that pain ripple through you.



No tears? Bad {isBoy: chico|{isGirl: chica|mascota}}. Earn my lash, Vamos!



Youre stiff as stone, pet. Move, or Ill break you open!



Dios! That was nothing, pequeno. Give me a proper shudder!



Barely a twitch, mi tesoro? Do better, or Ill make you regret it.



Carino, your silence bores me. Cry out, or face my wrath, Ahora!



No response? Bad {isBoy: chico|{isGirl: chica|mascota}}. Feel it this time!



Youre failing me, pequeno. Writhe like my whip demands!



Madre mia! So dull, mi joya. Show me your pain, or Ill double it.



That weak flinch insults me, carino. React, or Ill carve it out of you!



No scream, mascota? Lets try that again, with feeling, Vamos!



Dios mio! Youre lifeless, pequeno. Make your body sing for me!



Mi tesoro, your stillness angers me. Jerk and moan, or else!



Bad {isBoy: chico|{isGirl: chica|mascota}}. No quiver? Try again, Ahora!



What a pitiful show, carino. Give me pain worth watching!
