Do you remember from before, about how much I like puppies? #45

+ [yes]
    /perform do_bouncing_big excited 45
    Oh good! I'm glad you remember! #46

+ [no]
    /perform talk_one_finger amused 55
    It <i>was</i> a little while ago. #47

    /perform react_chuckle skeptical 65
    I guess you've been pretty busy. #48

- /perform idle_eager aroused 35
One of my favorite things in the <i>whole world</i> is playing with a puppy. #49

/perform talk_bashful aroused 75
So, I was wondering... #50

- (be_puppy)
/perform idle_cocks_head_to_left aroused 55
Is that something you're interested in? #51

/perform idle_pleased excited 45
Being my puppy? #52

+ [yes] -> Yuki_AcknowledgeYes ->

+ [no]
    -- (check_again_puppy)
    /perform idle_tease sad 45
    Oh, come on. Please? #54


    /perform idle_pleased happy 50
    It would make me so happy! #55

    ++ [yes] -> Yuki_AcknowledgeYes ->
    ++ [no]
        /perform react_shrug_long sad 45
        Well, okay. I don't really have anything else for you then. #56

- /perform do_bouncing_big
I love having new puppies to play with. #57

/perform talk_lean_forward aroused 65
<i>Good</i> puppies. #58

/perform do_shake_finger amused 45
And you can't be a good puppy until you learn how to behave like one. #59

/perform idle_clasp_hands excited 55
So pay attention! #60

+ [continue]
+ [distracted] -> Yuki_PayAttention ->

- /perform talk_consider happy 45
I'm going to teach you to respond to some basic commands first. #61

/perform talk_thoughtful skeptical 55
For now, you're just learning, so I'll ignore any mistakes you make. #62

/perform talk_lean_forward amused 65
But eventually, you're going to be tested on what I've taught you! #63

- (remember_pose)
/perform talk_emphatic_yuki scared 25
You really, really need to remember this stuff! #64

Okay? #65
/perform idle_yuki happy 35

+ [yes]
    /perform react_nod_little happy 45
    We'll find out how well you do later. #66

+ [no]
    /perform do_shake_finger_stern angry 25
    Then you're going to have a hard time later {isBoy:mister|{isGirl:missy|pet}}. #67

- /perform talk_one_finger excited 45
Alrighty, time for your first lesson! #68

/perform yuki_ready happy 55
When you're not doing anything else, you should <b>"sit"</b> and wait for a command. #69

/perform talk_one_finger amused 65
That should be <i>natural</i> for a puppy! #70

- (puppy_ready)

Ready to learn to <b>"sit"</b>? #71

/perform do_point_down happy 45
Get down on your knees, sit back on your heels, #72

/perform idle_unhappy happy 60
and rest your hands on the floor between your thighs. #73

/perform idle_unhappy_stomp sad 55
Look forward, not down! #74


+ [pose:puppy_sit]

+ [timeout] -> Yuki_Timeout -> puppy_sit

- (understand_sit)

/perform idle_yuki excited 45
Puppies always wait in this position until they are given a new command. #75
Understand? #76

+ [yes] -> Yuki_AcknowledgeYes ->

+ [no]
    -- (ask_sit_again)
    /perform idle_eager happy 65
    Always start in the <b>"sit"</b> position whenever you are a puppy, #77
    then follow commands from there. #78

    /perform idle_clasp_hands skeptical 60
    Make sense? #79

    ++ [yes] -> Yuki_GoodJob ->

    ++ [no]
        /perform react_disappointed angry 75
        Maybe we should try this some other time. #80

/perform react_chuckle amused 45
Now... #82

/perform talk_lean_forward happy 60
Puppies don't nod and shake their head like <i>people</i> do. #83

/perform talk_consider aroused 75
And you're a cute little puppy, aren't you? #84

- (puppy_yes_intro)

/perform idle_sassy happy 45
To say <b>"yes"</b>, raise your right hand... Er, <i>paw</i>... #85
Just an eensy, weensy bit. #86

+ [pose:puppy_yes] -> Yuki_GoodJob ->
+ [timeout] -> Yuki_Timeout -> puppy_yes_intro

- /perform talk_one_finger excited 45
You're not a boring, old human anymore, are you? #87

Raise your left paw slightly to say <b>"no"</b>. #88

- /perform idle_eager happy 75
Whenever you visit me as a puppy, #89
I'll make sure you get lots of practice! #90

/perform idle_pleased excited 70
Eventually, I'm going to test you on all your commands. #91

/perform do_bouncing_big excited 85
Won't that be so much fun? #92

/perform idle_swaying amused 65
Remember to answer like a proper puppy would. #93

    I can't wait until you're fully trained! #95

    -- (puppy_reminder)
    /perform react_whatever sad 45
    I thought puppies were supposed to have good hearing... #97

    /perform talk_one_finger skeptical 50
    First, I teach you new poses. #98

    /perform talk_two_fingers skeptical 65
    Then, you practice those poses. #99

    /perform talk_question amused 55
    Eventually, I test you on those poses. #100

- /perform do_blow_kiss happy 50
If you do well, I'll reward you for being a good {player_name}. #101

/perform idle_unhappy_stomp disgusted 55
Otherwise, I'll have to punish you for being a bad dog. #102

/perform react_sad_kick_foot_yuki sad 75
And puppy punishments are <i>not</i> as fun as puppy rewards. #103

/perform do_bouncing_little excited 50
But I'm sure you'll do super well! #104

And just to encourage you to try hard, #107
I'm going to give you a reward today #108
just for being my puppy! #109

/perform do_smooth_skirt happy 45
That's it for today, puppy. #105
