Intro

Player enters the room to find themself in a dark swamp. There’s a full moon shining bluish light onto weeping willows and mangroves. Insects and frogs sing their songs. At the end of a dark path that leads further into the swamp, there’s a pond that reflects the moon. A siren song is heard coming from the pond. A blue flame flickers and disappears. The player walks towards the flame as it continues to flicker and vanish. The song grows louder as they approach. The player stops at the edge of the pond and Caliste’s intro video begins.

A large blue flame wisps up from the waters and turns into Caliste, floating above the water. Her dress dipped in the water as though it were flowing into the pond. Her chest and head turned up towards the sky.

“Oh mighty Goddess (Déese?), I call upon you. Grace my circle with your power.”

Caliste spins in a circle, blue light shining down from her fingers and a circle lighting up the waters below her. 

“Goddess of the Earth. I call upon you. Grace my circle with your immovable mass.”

The earth below the player shakes. Caliste spins around again.

“Goddess of Air. I call upon you. Grace my circle with your blustering gail.”

A powerful wind rushes through. Caliste spins around again.

“Goddess of Fire. I call upon you. Grace my circle with your cleansing flames.”

A blue flame whooshes up from the pond, over Caliste and disappears. She spins again.

“Goddess of Water. I call upon you. Grace my circle with your surging floods.” 

Water gushes up from the circle and surges over the shore of the pond. 

“I draw this circle in honor of divine feminine. In honor of all the Goddesses that came before and after me. Pour your power into me so I may glorify your light and dark, your patience and spite, your kindness and viciousness. I am all and one.”
